A business process, or process, is a set of related activities or tasks performed together to achieve the objectives of the health programme area, such as registration, counselling, referrals. Workflows are a visual representation of the progression of activities (tasks, events, interactions) that are performed within the business process. The workflow provides a “story” for the business process being diagrammed and is used to enhance communication and collaboration among users, stakeholders and engineers. The workflows presented in the WHO Digital Adaptation Kit (DAK) for postnatal care (PNC) depict processes that have been generalized across different contexts and may not reflect the variability and nuances across different settings. The simplicity of the workflow may not adequately illustrate the nonlinear steps that may occur. 

For more details, please see component 4 "Generic business processes and workflows" in the WHO DAK for PNC.
