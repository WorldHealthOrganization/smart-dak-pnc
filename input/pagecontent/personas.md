A persona is a depiction of a relevant stakeholder, or end user, of the system. Although the specific roles and demographic profiles of the personas will vary depending on the setting, generic personas are based on WHO core competencies and credentials of different health worker personas. 

### Targeted generic personas 

The targeted personas for this Digital Adaptation Kit (DAK) are health workers operating in care settings that are able to provide the required essential interventions for the delivery of postnatal care. The key competences of midwives, nurses, physicians and community health workers (CHWs) are the primary health worker personas for the digital client health record and decision-support system. The key competences of these health workers are defined by WHO in the Table 2 of the DAK. 

### Related personas 

In addition to the targeted personas detailed in Table 2, there may be value in exploring other cadres and personas within the context of PNC services, such as social work and counselling professionals, pharmacists, and health service managers. However, these were not identified as the central personas for the data and decision-support content detailed in this DAK. Additional related personas are listed in the Table 3 of the DAK.
