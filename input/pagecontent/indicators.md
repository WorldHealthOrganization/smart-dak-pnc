This page includes indicators and performance metrics that would be aggregated from core data elements identified and extracted from the WHO Digital Adaptation Kit (DAK) for postnatal care (PNC) (link forthcoming). 


These indicators may be aggregated automatically from the digital tracking tool to populate a digital health management information system (HMIS). 

For machine-readable representations, see the <a href="indicators-measures.html">Indicators and Measures</a>.
