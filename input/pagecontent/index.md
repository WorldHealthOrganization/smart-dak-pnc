### Summary 
In line with the Sustainable Development Goals and the Global Strategy for Women's, Children's and Adolescents' Health, and in accordance with a human rights-based approach, postnatal care efforts must expand beyond coverage and survival alone to include quality of care. The World Health Organization’s (WHO) Departments of Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health and Ageing (MCA), and Sexual and Reproductive Health and Research (SRH) aim to improve the quality of essential, routine postnatal care for women and newborns with the ultimate goal of improving maternal and newborn health and well-being. WHO defines a positive postnatal experience as one in which women, newborns, partners, parents, caregivers and families receive information, reassurance and support in a consistent manner from motivated health workers; where a resourced and flexible health system recognizes the needs of women and babies, and respects their cultural context. The overarching aim of each postnatal care (PNC) contact is to provide women, newborns/infants, parents and caregivers with respectful, individualized, person-centred care regardless of the resource setting and of the specific set-up of the health system.  

The five-step Standards-based, Machine-readable, Adaptive, Requirements-based and Testable (SMART) pathway to advance the adoption of best clinical practices for providing quality PNC is presented below. 

### L1 Narrative guidelines
In order to assist health programme managers within the ministry of health (MOH), who will be working with their digital or health information systems counterparts in determining the health content requirements for PNC person-centred point of service systems (PCPOSS). The health programme manager is responsible for overseeing and monitoring the implementation of the clinical practices and policies for the health programme area, in this case PNC. This DAK focuses on providing the content requirements for PCPOSS used in any health-care setting by health workers providing PNC and is based on the [WHO PNC guideline: WHO recommendations on maternal and newborn care for a positive postnatal experience](https://iris.who.int/handle/10665/352658). 

### L2 Operational guidelines
Digital Adaptation Kits (DAKs) are designed to facilitate the accurate reflection of WHO’s clinical, public health and data use guidelines within the digital systems countries are adopting. DAKs are operational, software-agnostic, standardized documentation that distil clinical, public health and data use guidance into a format that can be transparently incorporated into digital systems. DAKs serve as a prerequisite for developing computable, or machine-readable, guidelines, as well as executable reference software and advanced analytics for precision health.
